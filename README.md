## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Visual Studio Code or another code editor

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project.

2. Open the `lab-01` folder in the terminal.

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the Express server:

```
node server.js
```

5. Open the following URL in your browser:

    `http://localhost:3000`

### Run the Basic HTTP Server

To run the server implemented using Node.js's built-in HTTP module:

```
node server-http.js
```

Stop the running server with `Ctrl + C` before starting another server on the same port.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint    | Description                                    | Expected Status |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| GET    | `/`         | Returns a welcome message                      | 200 OK          |
| GET    | `/about`    | Returns the student's name and section as JSON | 200 OK          |
| GET    | `/time`     | Returns the current date and time              | 200 OK          |
| GET    | `/anything` | Demonstrates the response for an unknown route | 404 Not Found   |

The `/anything` path is an example of an unknown route. Other undefined paths should also return a 404 response.

## Screenshots

### 1. Home Route

Displays the welcome message.

### 2. About Route

Displays the student's name and section in JSON format.

### 3. Time Route

Displays the current date and time.

### 4. Unknown Route

Displays the 404 Page Not Found response.

## HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested route does not exist.

## Viva Questions

### 1. What is the difference between `package.json` and `node_modules`?

`package.json` stores project metadata, scripts, and dependency information. `node_modules` contains the installed packages required by the project.

### 2. What does `app.listen()` do?

`app.listen()` starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming requests on a specified port.

### 3. What do `request` and `response` represent?

`request` contains information about the incoming HTTP request. `response` is used to send data and status codes back to the client.

## Problems Faced and Solutions

Document the actual problems encountered while completing the lab and how they were solved.

Example: If a port was already in use, stop the other server before starting the Express server on the same port.

## Git and Repository Notes

- The `.gitignore` file excludes `node_modules/` and `.env`.
- The `node_modules/` directory must not be committed.
- Screenshots are stored in the `screenshots/` directory.
- The project is submitted through the course GitHub repository.
